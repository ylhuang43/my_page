title: 'Project 2: Diversified Institutional Ownership and Firm Innovation' 
---

This project is my PhD dissertation and a single-authored research paper of my own.

In this paper, I explore the stock holdings of all 13F institutional investors from 1980 to 2019 and investigate whether institutional investors with diversified portfolios can have an impact on the innovation decisions of the firms they invest in. 

I find that innovation productivity improves along with an increase in ownership by diversified institutions. I use a **natural experiment design** based on financial institutional mergers from 1984 to 2010 and **difference-indifference analysis** to make **causal inferences** of the relationship. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that information complementarity drives the higher innovation productivity of firms held by diversified investors.

This is an on-going research project, but more details and a draft can be available upon request.
