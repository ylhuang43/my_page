title: 'Project 1: Asset Pricing Implication of Predatory Trading Risk' 
---
**Programming Language:** Stata

**Algorithm/Statical Approach Used**: Protfolio Analysis, Ordinary Least Square(OLS) Regression, Fama-MacBeth Regression, Risk-factor modeling, t-test

**Datasets:** Thomson Rueters S12 Mutual Fund Holding Database, Thomson Rueters S34 Institutional Holding Database,
CRSP Mutual Fund Holding Database, CRSP Monthly Stock Holding Database, Lipper TASS Hedge Fund Holding Data

**Description:**
This is one of the projects I worked on during my PhD. 

In this exploratory project, I hypothesize that predatory trading behaviors between mutual funds can impose un-hedgable risks to the assets in fund portfolios and have asset pricing implications. I construct a variable that would proxy for this risk and test if higher exposure to the risk is associated with higher **risk-adjusted return (alpha)** under traditional asset pricing models
