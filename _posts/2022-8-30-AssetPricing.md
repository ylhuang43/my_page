title: 'Project 1: Asset Pricing Implication of Predatory Trading Risk' 
---

This is one of the projects I worked on during my PhD.

In this exploratory project, I hypothesize that predatory trading behaviors between mutual funds can impose un-hedgable risks to the assets in fund portfolios and have asset pricing implications. I construct a variable that would proxy for this risk and test if higher exposure to the risk is associated with higher **risk-adjusted return (alpha)** under traditional asset pricing models
