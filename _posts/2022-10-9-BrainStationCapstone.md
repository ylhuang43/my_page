title: 'Project 4: Predicting COVID News Sentiment with NLP' 
---
**Project Objective:** Use machine learning models to predict sentiment of COVID-related news around the world.

**Programming Language:** Python

**Algorithm/Statical Approach Used**: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, 
Deep Neural Network, RNN, LSTM, Word2Vec Model Training

**Datasets:** AYLIEN News API Covid News Dataset

**Description:**
This project is my Capstone for BrainStation Data Science Boot Camp. In this project, I explored different NLP methods to process the Covid news article texts and predict article sentiment, including a Word2Vec embedding trained by my own neural network architecture.

I also try to build DNN models with RNN and LSTM layers for the prediction task. My best model has achieved about 69% accuacy.

This is an on-going project, and not all progress has been updated online, but you can find the previous version [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/ylhuang43/BrainStation-Capstone-NLP-Project).
