title: 'Project 3: Predicting COVID News Sentiment with NLP' 
---

This project is my Capstone for BrainStation Data Science Boot Camp. In this project, I explored different NLP methods to process the Covid news article texts and predict article sentiment, including a Word2Vec embedding trained by my own neural network.

A brief summary of the project can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/Capstone_Report.pdf).

More details, codes, and notebooks can be found [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/ylhuang43/BrainStation-Capstone-NLP-Project).
