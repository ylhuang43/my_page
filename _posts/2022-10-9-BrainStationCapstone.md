title: 'Project 3: Predicting COVID News Sentiment with NLP' 
---
**Programming Language:** Python

**Algorithm/Statical Approach Used**: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, 
Deep Neural Network, Word2Vec Model Training

**Datasets:** AYLIEN News API Covid News Dataset

**Description:**
This project is my Capstone for BrainStation Data Science Boot Camp. In this project, I explored different NLP methods to process the Covid news article texts and predict article sentiment, including a Word2Vec embedding trained by my own neural network architecture.

A brief summary of the project can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/Capstone_Report.pdf).
