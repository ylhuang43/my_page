I have a PhD in Finance and am experienced in working with large datasets. My research experience is highly quantitative and involves advanced statistical methodologies. I am a fast learner and a self-motivator who can independently develop solutions for complex questions. I am adept at using statistical and machine learning models to draw critical insights from data, and am actively looking for a data scientist position that involves advanced data analysis and modeling.

This page is where I showcase my data project experiences, and I welcome any discussion if they interest you!
